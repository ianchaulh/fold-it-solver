# fold-it-solver: a backtracking approach
[![forthebadge made-with-python](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This repository contains a backtracking-based algorithm to solve the Fold-It board game. The game description can be found on [thinkfun.com](https://www.thinkfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FoldIt-3550-Instructions.pdf).

## Game Overview
### Main
The core premise of this game is for players to manipulate a $4 \times 4$ square cloth with distinct items in each grid (identical sides). The player's goal is to find a sequence of folds along the clear vertical and horizontal lines that will result in only the selected items being present in the final "plan view" of the folded cloth.

While some combinations of target items may have straightforward folding solutions, others can be more challenging, requiring the player to apply extra spatial awareness, logical reasoning, and keen observation skills.

This project proposes a brute force solution and can be extended to tackle $m \times n$ cloth configurations.
